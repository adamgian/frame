		The trail is somewhat wide for singletrack and a bit technical with roots and rocks. For those that want to get tricksy, there are jumps littered throughout the trail as well. Out here you will find the most legal features including log rides, jumps and rock rolls in South Tahoe including the new jumps, berms, rollers and hips TAMBA and SBTS built in 2014. From there the trail stretches out and travels pretty fast into a big berm with a view out into the valley. Pretty dry and fast.

		Several high speed, low risk sections take you down the sandy open trail for some of the most fun downhills in the area. Lost Lake starts at its namesake trailhead. The start of the dirt road is marked on the Google Map directions on this page. This ridge is more rugged than the other two ridges. Stay straight when the trail intersects with a doubletrack and then bear left at an intersection with the winter/horse route.

		If you keep your momentum you can charge up pretty much all the climbs and the descents are steep and tricky. Very loose and dry. This trail begins with a small pump section with two smaller jumps and a third larger hip jump. Very windy so drying fast. This trail is now a designated one way from the Lee's Train/C$ intersection.
